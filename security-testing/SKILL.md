## Key Concepts
# Security Testing
The objective of Security testing, while most likely impossible, is to ensure that applications and systems are
resilient to attacks and free from vulnerabilities. This section covers various security testing methodologies,
including dynamic and static application security testing, fuzz testing, and security regression testing.
There are several types of testing:
- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components or functions of the codebase.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests the interaction between different components or systems.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Tests the application by providing random or unexpected inputs to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Static Analysis**: Analyzes the code without executing it to find potential vulnerabilities.
- **Formal Verification**: Uses mathematical methods to prove the correctness of algorithms and protocols.
Some types of testing overlap, for example, a unit test could also be a fuzz test. We will focus on testing and how it
applies to smart contracts, and use solidity as an example.
